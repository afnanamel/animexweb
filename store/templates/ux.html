      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are two distinct but interconnected disciplines crucial to designing digital products.
        UI design focuses on the visual and interactive elements of a product, such as its layout, colors, and buttons, while UX design is the broader 
        process of planning the entire user's interaction, ensuring the product is easy, logical, and enjoyable to use.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        In essence, UI is the "how it looks," and UX is the "how it feels and functions." Together they create products that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and user-friendly.
